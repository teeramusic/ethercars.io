There are hundreds of models, each in up to 9 colours. Each model comes with a description (and joke) so you can learn some cool facts and have some laughs! We have deliberately limited the supply to the hardcore minimum of 3003 to promote rarity (with no further releases), as opposed to the common 10,000-16,000 unit collections. The initial pre-sale is 0.13ETH per unit (randomised to which one you will get), followed by a regular sale. The regular sale pricing follows a bonding curve detailed below, based upon the prestige and rarity of each model.</p><div class="card rounded-lg"><div class="card-body"><h5 class="card-title">Bonding Curve</h5><p class="font-weight-bold mt-3">The initial pre-sale is 0.13ETH per unit, randomised, so you might get one worth EVEN MORE than 0.13ETH!
